.git folder is added

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging are is just a temporary list of files to be added in the commit, so it is a subset of the working directory. It offers the flexibility to select what to be tracked.
****staging area is a copy of the most recent commit until changes are added to it.

just add the file you want to commit a logical change to the staging area and commit it, do it with each logical change
